# ScienceWorld

ScienceWorld is a text-based virtual environment centered around accomplishing tasks from the standardized elementary science curriculum.  This code accompanies the paper [ScienceWorld: Is your Textual Agent Smarter than a 5th grader?](http://www.google.com).

# Quickstart
**Before running:** You will have to have `Java 1.8+` installed on your system (shipped with most linux distributions).

Install with pip:
```bash
conda create --name scienceworld python=3.8
conda activate scienceworld
pip install .
```

Run an example random agent, on task 13 (classification: place a non-living thing in a box), for 5 episodes:
> python examples/random_agent.py --task-num=13 --num-episodes=5 --simplifications-preset easy

Run a user console where you can interact with the environment, on task 3 (change of state: melting):
> python examples/human.py --task-num=3 --num-episodes=5


# ScienceWorld Design
ScienceWorld is written in Scala (2.12.9), and compiles using `sbt` into a JAR file that is run with `java`.  For convenience, a `python` API is provided, which interfaces using the `py4j` package.

**Ports:** ScienceWorld is nominally run as a server, which interfaces to the Python API with `py4j` through a port.  The default port is `25335`.  The actual port used will be 25335 + the thread number provided when a ScienceWorld class is instantiated.

**Threads:** ScienceWorld is designed to run many threads simultaneously, if desired.  To do so, initialize one `ScienceWorldEnv` object per thread, and provide a unique `threadNum` for each thread.  Don't forget to close down servers that you instantiate using the `env.shutdown()` command.  If you are spawning many threads (10+) at the same time, you may wish to add a short delay (5-10 seconds) after initialization to wait for all the servers to initialize.

# Tasks
The subtasks and their associated subtask indices are listed below.  Subtask indices are automatically assigned by sorting task names:

| SubTask #  | Task Name                                          |
